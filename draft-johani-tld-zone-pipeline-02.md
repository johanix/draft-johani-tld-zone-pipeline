--- abstract

Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones. The sequence of steps
from generating the unsigned zone, via DNSSEC signing and various types of
verification is referred to as the "zone pipeline".

The robustness and correctness of the zone pipeline is of crucial
importance and the zone pipeline is one of the most critical parts of
the operations of a TLD registry.

The goal of this document is to describe the requirements that the
.SE Registry choose in preparation for the implementation of a new zone
pipeline. The document also describes some of the design consequences that
follow from the requirements. Hence this document is intended to work as a
guide for understanding the actual implementation, which is planned to be
released as open source.

TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at:
[https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline](https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline).
The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be
available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.

# Introduction

Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones. This typically
leads to a zone production "pipeline" that consists of several steps,
including generation of the unsigned zone, signing of the zone and
various types of verifications that the zone is correct before
publication on the Internet.

In some cases, including the .SE Registry, the zone pipeline was not
the result of a clear requirements process, nor was it the result of a
concious design and implementation. Rather, it was the result of
combining various tools in a mostly ad-hoc way that achieved the goal
of moving the zone via signing and verifications towards publication.

When a critical part of the operation of a TLD registry is the result
of an ad-hoc process there are likely to be hidden risks. That was the
case for the .SE registry, which had a serious incident in February
2022. Because of that incident, .SE decided to re-evaluate the
requirements on the zone pipeline and then create a more robust
implementation from scratch.

This document aims to describe the requirements for zone production
(also known as "zone pipeline") that the .SE Registry choose in
preparation for the implementation of the new zone pipeline. It is
developed for the needs of the .SE and .NU TLD Registries, but the
conclusions are intended to be generally applicable.

## Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**",
"**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**",
"**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Purpose

A TLD Registry has a total responsibility towards society and the
Internet community to ensure, at any given time, public access to
correct versions of the DNS zones under their management. In order to
meet this commitment, three components are essentially required:

* Generation of unsigned zones from the Registry System.
* Quality control and signing of the zones.
* Publication of resulting signed zones.

The first step is handled by the Registry System. The third step is
handled by a combination of external providers of authoritative DNS
service and in-house DNS service. Both of these steps are out-of-scope
for this document

The sole purpose of this document is to provide a correct set of
requirements for the second step, between zone generation in the
Registry System and zone publication on the public Internet.

# Terminology

Upstream
: Further up in the zone pipeline, i.e. in the direction of the Registry System.

Downstream
: Further down the zone pipeline, i.e. towards the public Internet.

# Basic Design Principles

A number of fundamental principles are defined for the design of the
system. The intention of these principles is to minimize the risk that
the zone data (as generated by the Registry System) can somehow change
at any stage through the zone pipeline.

* Critical path for zone data must be via proven and well-reviewed
  standard software. This critical path is called the "zone pipeline".

  Rationale: Using well-established software used by others in the
  industry reduces development needs for the Registry. By not being
  critically dependent on self-developed software, the dependence on
  individuals is reduced.

* Standardized protocols shall be used as far as possible.

  Rationale: Individual components must be replaceable as easily as
  possible.

* Consequences of inaccuracies in custom software must be limited as far
  as possible and must never affect published zone data.

  Rationale: Obvious opportunities for risk minimization of a critical
  system within the business.

* Verification, signing and publication of the zone must be able to take
  place independently and without dependence on infrastructure outside
  the operating facility.

  Rationale: The ability to always maintain and publish an updated
  zone is the most important responsibility of the Registry. To ensure
  the ability to always maintain this ability the zone production must
  be self-contained.


# Interface to the Registry

Interface to the Registry System must be done according to
standardized protocols. This requirement has the following
consequences:

* Zone data must be retrieved from the Registry System using AXFR and
  IXFR {{!RFC5936}}.

* The request for publication of new zone data must be notified with DNS
  NOTIFY {{!RFC1995}}.

* Zone data published by the Registry System must contain a checksum in
  the form of ZONEMD {{!RFC8976}}.

# Local Updates

During normal operation, no changes to the zone data retrieved from
the Registry may take place. However, there may be situations where
the Registry is not reachable (nor is it expected to be reachable
within a reasonable time) and where local updates of zone data must be
able to be carried out. This can for example, be redirection of
socially important infrastructure.

In a crisis situation (emergency operation), zone updates must be able
to take place locally. Updates that take place in this way are
introduced into regular systems as soon as possible. Return to normal
operation may only take place after all changes made during emergency
operation have been introduced into the regular system.

Local updates must be applied using a strict and traceable method. It
must be clear at all times whether local updates have been applied,
what these are and who requested them.

In cases where local updates have taken place, ZONEMD MUST be updated.

N.B. Local updates are an extraordinary measure and must not be used
except in emergency situations. Procedures for who may request these
are decided by the Internet foundation's crisis management.

# Ingress Verification

Before signing, a number of checks must be performed on the zone
contents. The reason why checking must take place before signing is to
ensure that the zone being signed is always correct and can thus
continue to be re-signed in the event of problems upstream. The exact
checks to be carried out are set out in a separate specification and
are subject to local policy.

## Requirements on ingress verification

* The ingress verification must prevent an updated incorrect zone from
  being signed. An already approved previous version of the zone must
  continue to be signed until a new zone is approved.

* New zone controls must be able to be added without the component for
  ingress verification of zone data needing to be redesigned

* The interface from the zone pipeline to the ingress verification
  function must be DNS AXFR. This means that all controls must
  logically sit to the side and not be part of the critical
  path. I.e. the verification code is not part of the zone pipeline.

* All zone controls, self-developed or imported, must have local
  ownership within the organization.

## Examples of ingress verification checks

* Check that the zone data is complete.

* Check that the ZONEMD, which has been generated by the registry system, is correct

* Check that delegation information for the zone itself is correct.

* Check that the delta (i.e. the difference) between the current zone
  and the previous version is within approved limits.

* Check that certain crucial records are present and correct (the
  zoneâ€™s SOA record is one example).

# Signing

The task of the signing step is to keep an approved and received zone
signed for an arbitrary length of time until a new zone is received
from upstream (i.e. from Registry via Ingress Verification).

## Key management

The following requirements apply to the management of cryptographic
keys for signing zone data:

* The key material must be stored and used
  in an HSM that meets the security requirements set by the CISO.

* The interface for accessing the key material SHALL be PKCS#11.

* All keys must, to facilitate replication between different signing
  entities, be generated in advance.In order to facilitate replication
  between different signing entities, all keys must be generated in
  advance.

* Exchange of KSK can be initiated automatically or manually, and is
  automatically terminated when the DS record in the parent zone is
  updated (after according to an appropriate safety margin).

* Changing the KSK may only be completed if the DS record in the
  parent zone is updated.

* Replacement of ZSK must be done automatically.

## Zone signing

The following requirements apply to signing zone data:

* Signing must be done using key material via PKCS#11.

* The signing function must support algorithm rollover, e.g,. from RSA/SHA-256 to ECC/P-256/SHA-256.

* Signing must be done with either NSEC or NSEC3 semantics.

* If NSEC3 salt is used, the salt must be periodically changed automatically.

* Change of DNSSEC signing semantics from NSEC to NSEC3 and vice versa
  must be possible automatically.

* Previous signatures that are valid within a configurable time window
  shall be reused when re-signing, in order to reduce the rate of
  change on the zone.

* The signing function shall recreate the ZONEMD RR per {{!RFC8976}} after
  the zone has been signed.

# Egress Verification

After signing, several checks must be performed on the zone contents.
Apart from the obvious validation of generated DNSSEC signatures it is
also important to ensure that the signing step only added DNSSEC-
information without in any way modifying the unsigned data.

## Requirements on egress verification

* All generated DNSSEC signatures (RRSIG records) must be validated.

* The NSEC (or NSEC3) chain must be verified to be complete.

* The non-DNSSEC content of the signed zone must be provably identical
  to the corresponding unsigned zone that entered the signing step.

## Examples of egress verification checks

* Verify the zone with other software than was used for signing.

* Remove all data added by the signing step and check the ZONEMD value over that data with the ZONEMD from before the signing.

# Distribution

The following requirements apply to distribution of the signed zone:

* The signed zone must be retrieved from signing and egress
  verification to the distribution points with AXFR (not IXFR).
  
  It must be AXFR, as otherwise it is not possible to switch from one
  upstream to another in the distribution points (the IXFR from one
  upstream will not apply cleanly to a zone from another upstream).

* The signed zone shall be distributed to the designated authoritative
  name server services using AXFR/IXFR.

* To reduce convergence time towards the public Internet, the signed
  zone must be distributed with IXFR as far as possible.

* At least two complete zone publishing chains must be operational and
  always active.
  
  This is a policy decision, based on the strong intent to avoid all 
  single points of failure, including in the signing operation.

* Choice of zone publishing chain is an active configuration choice
  in each distribution point and must always be the same for all
  distribution points.

* The signed zone from the selected zone publishing chain must be
 retrieved by all distribution points in all operating facilities.


# Resulting Design Consequences

* The requirement on being able to prove that no unsigned data has
  been modified during signing is most efficiently fullfilled by
  computing the ZONEMD checksum on the unsigned data after signing
  (i.e. the signed zone modulo the DNSSEC related records DNSKEY,
  RRSIG. NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, apex CDS and CDNSKEY) and comparing
  that to the ZONEMD checksum for the corresponding unsigned zone.

* The ZONEMD checksums need to be stored outside the zone pipeline,
  indexed by the unsigned zone that each checksum corresponds to.

* The signed zone may (and will) change the SOA Serial independently
  of the unsigned zone. For this reason the ZONEMD checksums can not
  be stored using the SOA Serial as the index. Therefore a separate,
  unique, identifier is attached to each new version of the zone as a
  TXT record. A UUID is used as the identifier.

* Each unsigned zone MUST have a ZONEMD and a UUID index to store it
  under. Therefore changes to the unsigned zone via the local update
  facility must update the UUID in addition to any other change that
  is executed.

* The Registry runs multiple, parallel zone pipelines for the same
  zone with the requirement to be able to switch which pipeline is
  "active" at any time. As the local update facility is responsible
  for updating the UUID if a local change is needed, the same UUID
  will identify the exact same zone in all pipelines.

* The requirement that the zone pipeline only consists of proven and
  widely used software forces all local and custom software (including
  various tests and verification modules) to be located outside the
  zone pipeline. This cause a need for a component inside the zone
  pipeline with the ability to call an external "verifier" for
  verifications. At present only one such component is known (the
  authoritative nameserver NSD with its "verify:" attribute), but we
  hope that there will be more alternatives in the future.

# Security Considerations

The correct generation and DNSSEC signing of a TLD zone is a matter of
significant importance. As such requirements and methods for
verification of correctness is an important matter that has previously
not been much publically discussed.

As a requirements specification this document aims to make this topic
more public and visible with the intent of improving the correctness
of the requirements via public review.
